# Machine Learning Project 1 (Group: DAT)

### Description of the project
This project was conducted as part of the module CS-433 Machine Learning at EPFL. Our team applied different machine learning methods (linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, penalized logistic regression) to build a model that predicts the presence or absence of a Higgs Boson after a proton-proton collision, using characteristics of the collision.

### Description of the repository
The final model can be found in run.py, which creates a set of predictions that can be submitted to the AIcrowd platform.
To get predictions you just need:
1. Unzip files data/test.csv.zip and data/train.csv.zip in the folder data to files test.csv and train.csv, respectively.
2. Run run.py file ang get file  

The implementations.py file contains all the different machine learning methods used to build models. These methods can also be found in individual .py files named after them.

Finally, the notebook final_version.ipynb shows the process of preprocessing the data in 4 different ways, then trying to apply different algorithms to these 4 data sets.
