# MLproject1

This project was conducted as part of the module CS-433 Machine Learning at EPFL. Our team applied different machine learning methods to build a model that predicts the presence or absence of a Higgs Boson after a proton-proton collision, using characteristics of the collision.

The final model can be found in run.py, which creates a set of predictions that can be submitted to the AIcrowd platform.

The implementations.py file contains all the different machine learning methods used to build models. These methods can also be found in individual .py files named after them.

Finally, the notebook final_version.ipynb shows the process of preprocessing the data in 4 different ways, then trying to apply different algorithms to these 4 data sets.
